# Attendance_Management_System
The Smart Attendance System automates attendance using facial recognition. It creates a database, registers users by capturing 10-20 photos, and logs attendance with a timestamp. It detects unknown persons with a red frame, captures 5-10 photos, and saves them in the database for future reference.
